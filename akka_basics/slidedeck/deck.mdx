# The Actor Model

<Appear>
    <p> Actors are the primary unit doing work in the actor model. </p>
    <p> Actors communicate by passing messages. </p>
    <p> Each actor will only process one message at a time. Messages are (generally) processed in the order they are received (not necessarily the order they were sent.) </p>
    <p> Actors can be on the same machine, or spread accross many machines. </p>
    <p> The actor model makes both concurrency and distributed workloads easier. </p>
    <p>Actors can easily create children to handle dangerous tasks</p>
</Appear>

# Akka.Net
Port of the Akka actor model framework from Java / Scala.

# Actor System
<Appear>
    <p>An actor system must be created to contain actors.</p>
    <p>Actors can communicate within other actors in the system.</p>
    <p>Actors can communicate between actor systems.</p>
</Appear>

# Actors and Props
<Appear>
    <p>Props are similar to in React or Vue. They are a "recipe" for an Actor.</p>
    <p>Each Actor must have a unique name in their actor system.</p>
    <p>Each Actor has an address (more on this later)</p>
    <p>Actors have a mailbox (queue) of received messages.</p>
</Appear>

# Actor Types
* UntypedActor
    * Simple Actor to setup. Code is a bit less clean.
    * Does not require specifying messages types the Actor will receive.


* ReceiveActor
    * Generally preferred Actor type.
    * Allows you to easily specify handlers by message type.
    * Supports Behaviors and Stashes.

        { tokens: {4: [7]}, notes: "Comes through as an object, no type info available" },

    ]}

# Behaviors
<Appear>
<p>Behaviors enable a ReceiveActor to change how it handles messages.</p>
<p>Two primary methods, Become and BecomeStacked:</p>
<div>
    <h4>Become:</h4>
        <p>Calls a method to register new Receive handlers.</p>
        <p>Become is generally preferred over BecomeStacked.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>BecomeStacked:</h4>
        <p>The same as Become, but retains the previous set of behavios in the stack</p>
        <p>May call Unbecome to revert to previous behavior.</p>
</div>
</Appear>

---
export default Invert

# Stash
<Appear>
<p>The stash allows an actor to defer handling messages until later.</p>
<p>When messages are removed from the stash, they are inserted at the front of the mailbox queue.</p>
<p>Two methods to unstash messages:</p>
<div>
    <h4>Unstash:</h4>
    <p>Unstashes a single message from the stash and places at the front of the mailbox.</p>
    <p>Running this multiple times will result in the messages from the stash being in reverse order.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>UnstashAll:</h4>
    <p>Unstashes all messages in stash and places in the front of the mailbox.</p>
    <p>This retains the messages in the order they were stashed.</p>
</div>
</Appear>

        { ranges: [[11,15],[17,20]], notes: "This actor has two behaviors." },
        { range: [13, 14], notes: "The 'Waiting' behavior stashes all messages while waiting for a ServerUp message." },
        { tokens: {14: [5,6,7,8,9]}, notes: "Note that the message does not need to be passed into the Stash method." },
        { tokens: {13: [8,9,10]}, notes: "Once a ServerUp message is received, BecomeAvailable is called." },
        { range: [22, 26], notes: "BecomeAvailable changes the behavior to Available and unstashes any messages received." },
    ]}

# Asynchronous Work
<Appear>
<p>Two main ways to handle aync work.</p>
<div>
    <h4>ReceiveAsync:</h4>
    <p>Allows you to use async await.</p>
    <p>Blocks the actor from doing any additional work while the async handler is running.</p>
    <p>Can be useful for intentional rate limiting.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>ContinueWith().PipeTo:</h4>
    <p>Generally preferred method, is non blocking</p>
    <p>ContinueWith() is similar to a promise.then()</p>
    <p>PipeTo sends the result of the Continuewith method as a message to an actor of your choice</p>
</div>
</Appear>

<CodeSurfer
    code={asyncActor}

    steps={[
        { range: [2, 25], notes: "" },
        { range: [6, 7], notes: "This actor has both a ReceiveAsync and a Receive handler" },
        { range: [10, 15], notes: "The receiveAsync handler, gets to use async await, but will block this actor from other work." },
        { range: [17, 24], notes: "The receive handler does the same work, but in a non-blocking fasion."},
    ]}
/>

export default Invert

# Routers
<Appear>
<p>Routers allow you to automatically distribute work among a group of Actors.</p>
<p>Routers may be configured programmatically, or in a HOCON config file.</p>
<p>There are two general types of routers:</p>
<div>
    <p>Pool routers create their own child Actors based on the number of instances you configure.</p>
    <p>Group routers route between existing Actors you configure.</p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>There are several routing strategies available:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>RoundRobin</li>
        <li>SmallestMailbox</li>
        <li>ConsistentHash</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><i>Routers can also be configured to automatically scale. This is outside the scope of this brownbag.</i></p>
</Appear>

<CodeSurfer
    code={routerActor}
    title='Router'
    steps={[
        { range: [2, 15], notes: "" },
        { range: [8, 11], notes: "_workers is created as a Pool Router." },
        { lines: [9], notes: "This line creates a RoundRobinPool which will create 5 Worker actors, and distribute messages amongst them." },
        { lines: [13], notes: "Upon receiving a job, the actor forwards it to the pool." },
        { tokens: {13: [9]}, notes: "forward retains the original sender" }
    ]}

# Getting a reference to an Actor
* You should generally only communicate directly to certain Actors to avoid coupling:
    * Your parent, or child Actors.
    * The Sender of the message you are processing.
    * Actors you receive references to in your constructor/props.
    * Top Level Actors:
        * These are generally an API managing a type of work
        * You will generally either have a system object with an IActorRef or an Actor Address listing.

---

# Sending Messages
There are two primary ways to send a message:
* Tell
    * Tell is non blocking, and does not expect a response.
    * Tell is almost always the correct choice.
* Ask
    * Ask is an async method.
    * Expects a response.
    * Often used when getting data from outside the Actor System.
